<h2>FOREWORD</h2>


<p>The problem of the adolescent at work is a very
complex one; not only the economic, but also the
educational, physiological, and biological reactions
of industrial work have to be considered. The
present work does not attempt anything like a comprehensive
discussion of the subject; it is merely
a small contribution to existing knowledge of the
facts in regard to one section only: the physiological
effects of industrial work on growing girls.</p>

<p>The young, it is often said, are the nation's
capital. If by this we merely mean that they are
the force by which the material goods of the future
will be produced, our view of life is inadequate
and rather brutal, but if the words are given a
higher and more spiritual sense they become full of
significance. Youth is the future: from among
the young of to-day the parents, citizens, leaders,
prophets, artists of the next generation will arise.
Work at this age should be considered not only for
the shillings it will immediately produce, but partly
for its effects on the worker's productive power
later on, partly for its effects on character, physique,
mind. Dr. Stanley Hall says of modern industry:
"Not only have the forms of labour been radically
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[Pg vi]</a></span>changed within a generation or two, but the basal
activities that shaped the body of primitive man
have been suddenly swept away by the new methods
of modern industry.... Work is rigidly bound to
fixed hours, uniform standards, stints and piece-products,
and instead of a finished article, each
individual now achieves a part of a single process,
and knows little of those that precede or follow.
Machinery has relieved the large basal muscles and
laid more stress upon fine and exact movements that
involve nerve strain.... Personal interest in, and
the old native sense of responsibility for results,
ownership and use of the finished products, which
have been the inspiration and soul of work in the
past, are in more and more fields gone."<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> The
conditions of much work undoubtedly tend to become
mechanical, deadening, and soul-destroying.</p>

<p>A strong impression seems to haunt the minds
of some who are intimately in touch with working-class
conditions that adolescent labour is excessive
in amount, and that the resulting fatigue may be
cumulative in its effects and injurious to the continuance
of the race. Thus in 1904 Miss Anderson
and her colleagues of the Factory Department,
being invited to report on the subject of married
women's work, found themselves impelled to the
consideration of the previous life-conditions of the
women, and stated: "It is the employment of
women from <i>girlhood</i>, all through married life and
through child-bearing that impresses itself on the
mind. It is useless for any not familiar with the
conditions of mill life to pronounce any opinion
... they have no conception of the stress and
strain."<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii">[Pg vii]</a></span></p>
<p>More recently Mr. Arthur Greenwood in a pamphlet
(<i>The Schoolchild in Industry</i>, published by the
Workers' Educational Association, Manchester, 1914)
states that the fatigue and prolonged standing
characteristic of some factory industries produce
serious disease in girls and young women, "and, in
the opinion of many doctors, sterility." The same
impression may be found occasionally among Sick
Visitors and the like, who work among these women.
Whether there is a scientific basis for the belief it
is impossible to say; there is not at present sufficient
information.</p>

<p>The investigation embodied in the present volume
was undertaken in the hope that it would yield some
information as to the vitally important subject of
the biological effects of early employment, or, in
other words, the reaction on the woman and her
offspring of industrial employment in the adolescent
years. No statistical data have, however, been
obtained on this point; probably none such could
be obtained within the limits of a small inquiry
directed and financed by private persons. Even
in regard to the effects of industrial work on the
health of girls, without special regard to ulterior
effects, there is at present very little scientific
information.</p>

<p>I welcome Miss Collier's report, therefore, as a
pioneer effort; it is limited in scope and matter by
the nature of the undertaking, but I know that she
has spared no pains in collecting her facts, and has
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[Pg viii]</a></span>set them out without prejudice or bias. Her experience
has suggested to us the desirability of a form
of inquiry which is probably beyond the resources
of most private inquirers, but might well be undertaken
either by a Government department or by
some public fund for sociological research. Some
years ago, statistics of the anthropometrical measurements
of school children in certain districts were
published.<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> These figures were obtained from
elementary school records in rural and industrial
districts, and the results were valuable and instructive.
Such a survey of young people, aged
14 to 18, might usefully include not only those in
industry, but also those attending secondary schools,
who in certain districts belong to much the same
social grade, and often come from the same families.
Thus the material for a valid comparison would be
available, and the results, under scientific medical
guidance, might be of first-rate social importance.
Possibly also some light might be thrown upon the
subject by investigating the previous occupational
histories, from the onset of puberty onwards, of
patients in maternity hospitals, and tabulating the
results with the nature of the confinement, whether
normal, difficult, or complicated.</p>

<p>In conclusion, Miss Collier and I wish here to
offer our best thanks to the many friends who kindly
allowed themselves to be interviewed, and gave
the help and information necessary for carrying out
the inquiry.</p>

<h2><a name="INTRODUCTION" id="INTRODUCTION">INTRODUCTION</a></h2>


<p><i>Numbers Employed.</i>&mdash;The whole number of girls
employed from 10 to 21 years of age amounted in
1911 to over a million and a half, or about 40 per
cent of the total female population of that age. If,
however, we restrict ourselves to the adolescent girls
at the ages 14 and under 18, we find that the total
number employed amounted to nearly 794,800, or
58·6 per cent of the whole. The 41·4 per cent
unoccupied include girls of the class in which women
do not work for money, girls studying who intend to
follow a profession or occupation, and some girls
of the higher industrial classes who attend school
one, two, or three years beyond the elementary
school age. There must also be in this group
some proportion of working-class girls who are
kept at home to help their mothers, and a small
number of invalids and imbeciles who are incapable
of work.</p>

<p>Of the 794,800 girls occupied, it is interesting to
note that 30·5 per cent had entered service (including
hotel service, but not including laundry and washing
service). If we take the whole domestic group which
includes laundry and charing as well as service, we
find it takes up 34·8 of the total girls employed.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[Pg x]</a></span>Considering how much complaint is frequently made
of the unwillingness of girls to enter these ancient
and traditional paths, it is worth noting that one
girl in every three actually does so, and the girls
who stay at home to help their mothers, if we knew
their numbers, would bring this proportion up a
good deal higher.</p>

<p>The textile trades employ 16·8 of our occupied
girls, and the various dress trades 19·2. We thus
find nearly 71 per cent of occupied girls are engaged
in the occupations constantly associated with their
sex and regarded as "womanly," although in modern
times nearly all textile and a considerable proportion
of the dress and laundry trades are organised
on factory lines. The other 29 per cent are dispersed
over the clerical, artistic, and other professions, and
in miscellaneous factory industries.</p>

<p>The proportion of girls employed varies from one
place to another; it is highest in districts where
there is a well-marked industry, especially where
textile factories absorb a large proportion of female
labour. <a href="#Page_56">Table II.</a> shows the proportion of girls in
a few selected districts. In industrial districts the
proportion of domestic servants is very low, and
the figures bring home to us the fact that in certain
districts a large proportion of the female population
spends the transition from childhood to adult life
in the mill.</p>

<p>It is, however, useless to spend much time over
these figures, which have become completely out
of date through the war. No details for young
workers are obtainable in official statistics, but the
increase in numbers of females employed in industry
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xi" id="Page_xi">[Pg xi]</a></span>since the outbreak of war was estimated in July
1917 at 23·7, while the increase in professional and
other occupations, including transport, was 82 per
cent. The total increase in industry, commerce, and
government service of various kinds amounted to
over 1,420,000, or 42·5 per cent.<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> It is probable
that the increase among girls of 14 to 18 was at least
no less than among female workers generally. The
net increase in numbers must also be only an imperfect
indication of the enormous changes within
the employed group. The Munitions group, the
metal trades, all the textile and other trades that
produce the clothing and other accoutrement of
soldiers, the supply of food and comforts for the
army, all these industries have expanded considerably
and have drawn recruits not only from the
unoccupied but from the domestic workers, and from
many other less indispensable occupations. Women
and girls have also taken the places of men and boys
in many civilian occupations.</p>

<p><i>The Factory Act.</i>&mdash;During the war the regulations
of the Factory Act have been considerably relaxed
or suspended. The strain of industry on the immature,
however, though undoubtedly intensified by
the war, was already a matter of anxious consideration
before 1914. Even in times of peace the
Factory Act vouchsafes to the adolescent worker a
meagre and inadequate protection. As regards
hours of work, "young persons," <i>i.e.</i> such as are
between 14 and 18, and also such as though only
13 have obtained a school attendance certificate,
are placed on a level, but for some trifling exceptions,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xii" id="Page_xii">[Pg xii]</a></span>with adult women. The hours of work for both
classes are the same, viz.: 10 hours in textile
factories, 10&frac12; in non-textile factories and workshops,
plus meal times. It is thus legal for a girl of 13, a
mere child, as most people would call her, to be at
work "all round the clock," or, including meal
times, for full 12 hours. On Saturday there is
a half-holiday. The only difference in regard to
hours is that in certain industries women are
permitted overtime, which is prohibited to young
persons.</p>

<p><i>Medical Inspection.</i>&mdash;There is, however, a provision
special to workers under 16, which is of
interest, and that is the requirement of a certificate
by the certifying factory surgeon that the young
person is physically fit for the proposed employment.
The surgeon has power to reject boys and girls for
work he considers unsuitable to them, and he may
also make certain qualifications or conditions as to
the kind of work on which the boy or girl should
be employed. It is evident that here we have a
provision with great possibilities of good for young
people. The unfortunate side of the matter is that
the certifying surgeon is not concerned with the care
of the child; he is merely remunerated by the
employer to fulfil a legal formality. Within a few
years the Women Factory Inspectors have, however,
taken the matter up and initiated action in the
interests of rejected children. The system has been
shown to be most unsatisfactory. No certificates
are required for other than factory industries, so
that in many cases rejected children go to some
employment which may be more harmful than the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiii" id="Page_xiii">[Pg xiii]</a></span>one for which they have been rejected, or may
even be admitted by one factory surgeon into the
very occupation for which another had disqualified
them.</p>

<p>Equally serious is the absence of any system of
medical advice or treatment for the cases in which
physical defect or disease has been notified. For
these and other reasons it is highly desirable that
the factory medical service, so far as it relates to
juveniles, should be absorbed in the School Medical
Service, which for nearly ten years has been doing
such good work in the detection and to some extent
the treatment of pathological conditions among
school children. This body is far better placed
than the certifying surgeons, as the whole of the elementary
school population passes under its hands.
Medical inspection could then become a condition
of all employment, instead of, as at present, factory
employment merely, and suitable arrangements
could be made without much difficulty for medical
care and treatment where necessary. It would be
likely, also, that the school doctors would take a
more enlightened view of factory conditions and
the needs of adolescence than the certifying surgeons,
and would have the Education Authority at their
backs in urging the importance of healthful conditions
on the employer in the factory.<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

<p><i>The Industrial Conditions needed for the Young.</i>&mdash;In
regard to girls the importance of adapting conditions
of work to the needs of the immature woman
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiv" id="Page_xiv">[Pg xiv]</a></span>is a matter of thought and care, of details intelligently
combined into a coherent whole. Given
suitable arrangements it need by no means be
assumed that the factory is inherently injurious to
women and girls. Several persons whose views
have been included in the following report even
thought that factory life was beneficial in some
respects. Dr. Louis Starr also says: "While there
is no question of the evils of child-labour, more
of the young suffer from too little than too much
use of the muscles. Where harm comes the blame
should not be put upon the mere work, but upon the
unhealthy surroundings, bad work-rooms, long hours,
great monotony, over-specialisation and excessive
use of the accessory and neglect of the fundamental
muscles."<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

<p>The principle of economic individualism has been
definitely thrown over by all but a few invincible
doctrinaires, and it is coming to be recognised that
the shoe must fit the human foot and not the foot
be cut down to suit the shoe. We are beginning,
greatly daring, to foresee a time when directors of
industry will be required to revise their schemes of
management or even to construct new ones, not
merely to avoid injury to workers, but with the view
of promoting their healthy mental and physical
development. Hours of work must be considerably
shortened for young workers, rest pauses must
be introduced to minimise fatigue, time must be
allowed for physical exercise, education, and recreation,
and the whole surroundings of work modified
with a regard for the personality of the workers.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xv" id="Page_xv">[Pg xv]</a></span>The question of speed is of special importance in
regard to young girls. In America, where speed
and strain have been and still are extreme, it is
beginning to be recognised by the most enlightened
employers that it is useless to urge the human
organisation beyond the power of endurance. In
some cases speeds have been reduced to get the best
results.<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

<p>Detailed study is necessary in order to adapt the
work to the capabilities of the workers. In Miss
Collier's reports several interesting notes will be
found on the desirability of picking strong girls for
certain kinds of work: on the need of seats, and
specially of the right kind of seats, and other points.
When a new Factory Act comes under consideration,
as we hope it may after the war, the needs of youthful
workers will be the point that most urgently requires
emphasis and re-statement, and I venture to hope
that the then Home Secretary will take account of
Miss Collier's investigation.</p>

<p>The war has shown us the extraordinary elasticity
of productive power in modern times. In response
to an urgent national need, material production
has been stretched to a point that would have been
incredible a few years ago. This is surely an indication
that&mdash;apart from the present need for enormous
quantities of war-material&mdash;production can satisfy
the bodily wants of men and yield a surplus for the
higher needs of civilised communities without excessive
toil, certainly without overtaxing the young
and immature. Further, much evidence collected
both before and during the war indicates that overwork
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xvi" id="Page_xvi">[Pg xvi]</a></span>is relatively unproductive compared with work
for reasonable hours. All this shows that we can,
if we wish, decide to be the master of the machine
and not its slave. The knowledge and the power
are there: let not the will be lacking.</p>

<h2><a name="INVESTIGATION" id="INVESTIGATION">INVESTIGATION</a></h2>


<p>Little attention has been given until quite recent
times to the effects of industrial work on the health
and physique of adolescent girls. Child labour has
been the subject of much discussion, and medical
investigations have shown the detrimental influence
exerted by wage-earning employment on the plastic
organism of the growing child. It is recognised that
with children bodily work often produces a greater
degree of fatigue both mental and physical than
does mental work of equal duration. The various
legal restrictions limiting the hours and controlling
the conditions of the labour of children, although
inadequate in extent and sometimes only permissive
in character, are evidence of a realisation that the
well-being of the child is of more importance than its
immediate commercial utility. This recognition of
the necessity of guarding against overstrain during
the critical early years does not, however, extend
to the period of adolescence. The restrictions of the
hours of work and the conditions of employment of
young persons of both sexes differ but slightly from
those applying to adult women. This failure to
appreciate the special problems of adolescence is the
more remarkable in that medical evidence has shown
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>that young children grow and develop despite great
hardships, while adolescence is more dependent upon
favouring conditions in the environment, disturbances
of which more easily retard development and
effectively injure the still growing body. "In late
adolescence contrasted with earlier life there is more
variation in growth, much greater liability to retrogression,
and increased susceptibility to outside
influences, unfavourable surroundings, and conditions
more readily causing arrest of growth and preventing
perfect maturity."<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p>

<p>In the evidence before the Physical Deterioration
Committee in 1904, Dr. Eichholz<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> emphasised the
need of close attention to the physical condition of
young girls who take up industrial work between
the ages of 14 and 18, for the conditions under
which they work, rest, and eat doubtless account
for the rapid falling off in physique which so frequently
accompanies the transition from school to
work. And the summary of that Committee states:
"The period of adolescence is responsible for much
waste of human material and for the entrance upon
maturity of permanently damaged and ineffective
persons of both sexes. The plasticity of the human
organisation, the power it possesses of yielding
rapidly towards degenerative or recuperative influences
appears to terminate at 18."</p>

<p>This sketch of the conditions and circumstances
of the girl in industry was undertaken as a contribution
to the study of the effects of industrial employment
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>on the health and physique of the female
population of the country, and it was hoped that
in the course of the investigation some light would
be thrown on the question of the relation of the
employment of the young girl to her health after
marriage. Only a minority of women are normally
employed at any time, but as an examination of the
figures in <a href="#Page_55">Table I.</a> shows, a large majority of girls
between the ages of 15 and 19 are employed, and
of these more than one-half work in manufactures,
over two-thirds of the factory and workshop girls
being absorbed in the textile and clothing trades.
It follows from this that the majority of women
have been employed during the critical years of
adolescence which have so great an influence on the
physical constitution of later years.</p>

<p>As it was impossible in a private inquiry, such
as this, to cover a wide range, certain industries
which seemed to offer the best scope for the investigation
were selected and subjected to as detailed an
examination as was possible. The entrance of large
numbers of girls and young women into the industries
connected with the manufacture of munitions
suggested Birmingham and Coventry as fruitful
fields of inquiry, and the increase in welfare supervision
with appointment of matrons and nurses in
charge of surgeries and rest-rooms seemed to indicate
that the required information would be easily
obtained, while the abnormal conditions prevailing
in these industries offered a favourable ground for
investigation in that they afforded unusual opportunities
of studying the effects of excessive hours of
work, night work, and other variations in hours and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>conditions of employment. In addition to collecting
evidence from a number of these supervisors in the
factories, I endeavoured to find out from social
workers, in touch with girls outside the factory, how
far the abnormal conditions due to the pressure of
war work are affecting the general health of girls.
It is only natural that patriotic zeal and a desire
to earn good money on piece-rates may mask any
possible evil influences that long hours and increased
speeding up may exert, so that the evidence from
those in charge of girls in the factories, if considered
alone, might not disclose the true state of affairs.
Since it was impossible to get statistical evidence
as to output, accidents, and actual industrial fatigue,
I interviewed secretaries of Girls' Clubs and Care
Committee workers connected with the Birmingham
Juvenile Advisory Boards, who were in touch with
girls between the ages of 14 and 16. I saw also a
number of medical men and women with panel
practices in industrial districts. The certifying
surgeons were not able to give me any information,
as they deal only with young persons who are commencing
their industrial careers.</p>

<p>But it is from the textile trades that the great
mass of the evidence is derived. The cotton industry
of Lancashire and the wool and worsted industries
of the West Riding of Yorkshire, built up as they
are on the labour of children and young persons,
offered a much wider field than the non-textile
trades, and here, where the girls join their Trade
Union directly they are working full time, there is
much more class consciousness and reflection upon
industrial conditions. Consequently evidence as to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>these industries, together with that of the clothing
trade, is derived mainly from the Trade Union
officials, particularly from the Sick Visitors of the
Insurance sections, and from meetings of operatives
called together for the purpose by the Trade Union
secretary. In the course of the inquiry I visited
a number of mills, both spinning and manufacturing,
and thus gathered a good deal of information from
employers, managers, and overlookers. A certain
number of doctors were also visited, and some of
these supplied much valuable evidence, but it must
be remarked here that many doctors, possibly from
stress of work, fail to note the relation between
occupation and disease except in extreme and
obvious cases, particularly in towns where one main
industry occupies a large proportion of the inhabitants,
and where one imagines deductions as to
occupational disease and tendencies to disease could
be most easily made.</p>

<p>In addition to the engineering and textile trades
I have collected evidence from a few miscellaneous
industries in the various towns I have visited,
generally from "good" employers, who have made
some study of industrial fatigue or whose interest
in the welfare of their employees had directed their
attention to some of the problems under discussion.</p>

<p>The evidence from the clothing trade was collected
at Hebden Bridge and from various other towns
where wholesale tailoring is merely a subsidiary
industry. The conditions in Hebden Bridge due to
the ever-present shortage of female labour make
these clothing operatives the aristocrats of their
trade, so that the general results of industrial work
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>here had to be correlated with the evidence from
the clothing trade in other towns.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">General Conclusions</span></h3>

<p><i>Hours.</i>&mdash;The evidence to be considered under
this heading is concerned with various factors: the
total number of hours worked each week, the length
of the spells, and the number and length of the
pauses for rest and meals, as well as the time of
employment, <i>i.e.</i> day or night work.</p>

<p>At the time when the inquiry was initiated
(October 1916), practically all the munition factories
in Birmingham were working a 60-hour week, and
only in a very few cases had three 8-hour shifts
been tried. This was due mainly to the difficulty
of securing sufficient male labour for setting tools,
etc., and also to the fact that there was already
some difficulty in getting enough female workers.
Similarly in Coventry the total weekly hours ranged
between 55 and 60, though at one factory visited
girls under 18 worked only 47 hours, and those over
18 worked 53 hours. The evidence of Welfare
supervisors and nurses in charge of rest-rooms
went to show that these long hours had not exerted
the bad effect that had been expected. Various
witnesses stated that "no signs of undue fatigue
had been observed," "no increased sickness since
the hours had been lengthened," "the strain of the
long hours is considerable, but actual breakdowns
are rare." Another witness is "quite astounded"
at the good standard of health after a long period
of 55-hour weeks. One witness, a medical woman
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>who had examined the girls at a factory working
10 hours and more per day for six and sometimes
seven days per week, found no marked deterioration
when she examined them again at the end of six
months. But she stated emphatically that the good
food now obtainable because of the better wages
was largely responsible for this result. It must be
remembered that in pre-war times the average wage
for girls on simple engineering processes in Birmingham
and district was about 8s. to 10s. per week,
while now they would get 16s. to 30s., and it must
be concluded that some of the girls under discussion
were now adequately nourished for the first time
in their lives. Again, the results of this particular
inquiry must be taken as representing the survival
of the fittest, as many of the girls examined the first
time the doctor visited the factory had left, possibly
because of ill-health, before the second visit.</p>

<p>Nearly all the witnesses quoted above insisted
that the high standard of health that prevailed was
due mainly to better living and increased care,
which did much to mitigate the possible evil effects
of the long hours. One matron pointed out that
girls who are earning good wages and who are therefore
financially independent, get far better care and
attention at home than if they are not earning, and
this prevents breakdowns.</p>

<p>There is, however, another side to this optimistic
picture, and this is presented by some of the doctors
interviewed and by Girls' Club secretaries and Care
Committee workers. One woman doctor stated that
there is much increased sickness&mdash;anaemia, gastric
disturbances, etc., among girls working long hours.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>Another doctor declared that the fatigue resulting
from long hours of labour frequently leads to acute
anaemia and then to irregular menstruation, and
he said that the greater part of the work was not
too heavy and not entirely unsuitable for girls, but
that the hours were so long as not to allow time to
recover from fatigue.</p>

<p>The secretaries of Clubs and Care Committees
were unanimous in their condemnation of the present
system of long hours. They say the girls they come
across are thoroughly worn out, "languid and lacking
in vitality," "pale and nervous," and "incapable
of taking an interest in anything." The fatigue
seemed to affect them mentally more than physically;
thus the worker at one Club said that the girls
working long hours, <i>i.e.</i> about 60 per week, were
quite incapable of brainwork, so all classes, even
needlework, had to be stopped, but they could stand
the most strenuous drill and gymnastic work for
two evenings a week and did not want to stop when
the Club closed: the constrained nature of their
work, generally tending automatic machines, seemed
to increase their restlessness, and they are glad to
work it off in any occupation involving movement.
In case this point, which others corroborated, seems
to contradict the view that the long hours made the
girls lethargic and apathetic, it must be mentioned
that this same witness said that when any girls
were working 1&frac12; hours over their 10 hours, they
were fagged physically as well as mentally and
would not have the energy to drill, etc., but would
just sit and watch the others. As a general rule
the girls do not complain of the long hours, and very
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>few cases of complete breakdown are recorded.
This is attributed to the higher standard of living
made possible by the increased wages and to the
fact that many girls have been lost sight of since
the pressure of work has become so great.</p>

<p>The evidence from a few miscellaneous industries,
drawn as it is from the experience of a few "good"
employers, is of a very different nature. Here the
hours worked seldom, if ever, exceed 9 per day,
and in some instances experiments had been tried
with an 8-hour day with satisfactory results to
both health and output. It must be remembered
that most of the work done by girls in these miscellaneous
factories is of an intensely monotonous
nature&mdash;packing and sorting finished goods, "taking
off" on printing machines, making cardboard boxes
or tin canisters, but, at the same time, the work is
very light and easy and is learnt in a day or so,
although some weeks may elapse before the maximum
speed is attained. The only danger in these light
automatic processes is the temptation, often encouraged
by the employer, of excessive speeding up,
but to this I will refer later. As a general rule, the
evidence from this group goes to show that the
standard of health among girls working 8 or 9 hours
a day is quite satisfactory, and the sickness rates
are very low. How far these good results are due
to the shortness of the working-day compared with
that of the munition and textile industries, and how
far to the various "welfare" provisions, such as
special attention to delicate girls, supply of hot
drinks in the middle of the morning and afternoon
spells, gymnastic classes during work hours and so
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>on, it is difficult to say. It is interesting to note
that one employer reported that the addition of
two hours' overtime to a 9-hour day for three
days a week caused excessive fatigue after a few
months, so that the overtime was stopped, but
after a month the pressure of work was so great
that they had to return to it, and now they find
that this excessive fatigue is avoided, or, rather,
fatigue so extreme as to diminish output is avoided
by working every fourth week without overtime.</p>

<p>Turning now to the textile industry, particularly
the cotton trade of Lancashire with its 55&frac12;-hour
week and its 6 <span class="smcap">A.M.</span> start, we find opinion somewhat
divided. A certain number of employers and their
representatives declared that the hours worked exert
no detrimental effect on young girls, and that the
time lost through sickness is very slight. But these
statements are outweighed by the evidence of most
of the inside managers and some of the employers
interviewed. One of the latter firmly believed that
the present working hours are too long for young
girls, and had often noticed how they fell off in
health. Another states that young workers find
the long hours very tiring and that a shorter working-day,
which would be an advantage for all, is almost
a necessity for young girls, although he has no
exact evidence that the hours worked are actually
detrimental.</p>

<p>But the heaviest indictment against the 10-hour
day comes from the Trade Union representatives.
Many of these declare that the girls are utterly worn
out at the end of the day and are generally incapable
of any serious work, which accounts for the small
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>proportion of girls who attend Workers' Educational
Association and other evening classes. The strain
of most of the work in cotton factories, both on the
preparing and on the manufacturing sides, is considerable,
and the competition to increase output is
very great. Girls and women are indirectly set to
emulate one another and to compete with men and
boys. Some observers say that the girls are tired
out by 4.30 <span class="smcap">P.M.</span>, and that if the hours were reduced
the output would be more regular, as at the present
time girls are unconsciously forced to "slack."
The Sick Visitors of one of the large Weavers'
Unions in north-east Lancashire state that "shorter
hours are far more important for the well-being of
the weaver than either weavers or manufacturers
realise," and they point out that the girls look much
brighter and better when they are away from work
with minor ailments, and certainly the sickness
returns show that fewer are ill when "short time"
is general as in the latter half of 1914. This is confirmed
by the experience of other Unions. The
weaving master in one of the technical schools, who
had been a working weaver for years, was convinced
that the hours are too long for all operatives, but
especially for growing girls, and he said, "One has
only to live in a household of weavers to notice the
extreme weariness and lassitude with which they
sink into chairs as soon as they get home in the
evening."</p>

<p>As a proof of the evil effects of the long working-day
my attention was frequently drawn to the
physical differences between the girls attending the
secondary schools and those who work in the mills.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>In the majority of cases, particularly in north-east
Lancashire, both groups come from the same class
and from the same type of home, but the former
are tall, well-built, and rosy-cheeked, while the latter
are often short, always thin, and generally pale and
anaemic.</p>

<p>The comparison between the different effects of
weaving and winding is instructive. The latter
process is of itself more tiring and monotonous, and
the strain is continuous; yet winders are said to
be in better health and to be much more cheerful
and energetic out of work hours. This apparent
inconsistency is explained by the fact that the
winders seldom work a full week; they frequently
start after breakfast, and generally "play" on
Saturday and one other morning every week.</p>

<p>One witness emphasised her conviction that the
long hours were mainly responsible for the very
prevalent ill-health of girls and of older women by
declaring that no reform of factory conditions can
be effective until the hours are shortened.</p>

<p>The medical witnesses were also unanimous in
their belief that the long hours of confinement in
the close atmosphere of the mill is the cause of much
of the ill-health that is prevalent among girls about
16 and 17. The fatigue resulting from the hours
of labour weakens their resistance to disease, and
they are liable to fall victims to any epidemics,
while anaemia, gastric and menstrual disturbances
are very frequent about this age.</p>

<p>The worsted industry told the same tale. Many
of the employers interviewed were in favour of a
shorter working-day, as the younger operatives get
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>very tired at 4.30 <span class="smcap">P.M.</span> and work suffers, while a
Trade Union representative declared that the hours
are exceedingly fatiguing for all female workers,
particularly for growing girls, who, unlike the men
and boys, practically in all cases have domestic
work when the factory day is over.</p>

<p>The majority of the employers in the clothing
trade had never given any consideration to the
effects of the hours on the health of their operatives.
Consequently they were vehement in declaring that
a 52-hour week exerted no injurious influences. On
the other hand, the Sick Visitors of the local branches
of the United Garment Workers' Union were confident
that the 9&frac12;-hour day in the confined
atmosphere of the factory was particularly harmful
for young girls, and they pointed out that the sickness
returns were always lower during slack time
and during strikes, while other witnesses, although
unable to make any definite statement on the effects
of the hours worked, said that very few girls at the
clothing factories have much energy for Continuation
and Workers' Educational Classes after their full
day's work.</p>

<p>In non-textile factories 5-hour spells are very
common. All the doctors interviewed spoke very
strongly against this practice. It is noteworthy
that far more accidents are reported as occurring in
the 5-hour spells than in shorter periods, and the
general opinion is that the spell is too long for health
and efficiency. In many munition factories short
breaks for ten or fifteen minutes have been instituted
in the 5-hour spells, and trolleys from the canteens
are sent round with cheap refreshments. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>benefit derived from this system is everywhere
acknowledged, and the wonder is that so few experiments
with rest pauses have been tried. The
4&frac12;-hour spell also comes in for much criticism, and
some observers say that the girls are thoroughly
fatigued at the end of the time, while the Welfare
supervisor at one works goes so far as to say that
the last half-hour even of a 4-hour spell drags so
heavily with the younger workers that a 3&frac12;-hour
spell would be a distinct advantage both to health
and to output.</p>

<p>The continuous 4&frac12;-hour spell allowed by the
Factory Acts for the textile industry is seldom
adopted in either the cotton or worsted trades, the
most usual hours being 6 <span class="smcap">A.M.</span> to 8 <span class="smcap">A.M.</span>, 8.30 <span class="smcap">A.M.</span> to
12.30 <span class="smcap">P.M.</span>, and 1.30 <span class="smcap">P.M.</span> to 5.30 <span class="smcap">P.M.</span> Very little
attention has been paid to the effects of the 4-hour
spells as such, and though many observers say that
girls are thoroughly fatigued by 3.30 or 4.30 <span class="smcap">P.M.</span>,
this seems to be due mainly to the total number of
hours already worked rather than to the fatiguing
influence of the individual spell. With regard to
the early morning start characteristic of these
industries, opinion was sharply divided. Some
employers and Trade Union representatives declared
that no ill-effects resulted, while others were most
insistent that the work before breakfast was the
cause of much illness and discomfort. Whilst it is
impossible to dogmatise in the face of these conflicting
statements, especially in view of the fact
that neither side can produce scientific evidence in
its defence, so that the statements are probably the
result of social and domestic considerations, it may
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>be assumed that the early start is harmful in the
cold winter months, but that it does not of itself
exert any injurious influence in the summer.</p>

<p>Night work for juvenile workers is now almost
universally condemned. The effects of such work
are more marked than with adult workers, the
nervous strain is considerable, and lassitude and
weariness invariably accompany the night shift.
This results in spite of the fact that girls are reported
to sleep well during the day, unlike the older women,
whose domestic concerns frequently prevent sleep
in the daytime. Some witnesses from Birmingham
and Coventry report that night-work was still
(November 1916) common for juvenile workers.
Where Welfare Workers are in charge, however, they
endeavour to restrict it to girls over 16, though
even with these the fatigue is considerable, as sleep
is frequently broken by the mother waking the girl
to partake of the family mid-day meal. Evidence
as to the relative merits of long and short periods
of night-work are so conflicting that it is impossible
to draw any conclusions, and as the question is
receiving considerable attention from the Health
of Munition Workers' Committee, it was not made
the subject of special investigation.</p>

<p>Some explanation of the conflict of evidence
recorded under this section of the inquiry may be
found in the outlook of the witnesses interviewed.
Where increased output and commercial profit were
the chief concern, so long as few actual breakdowns
occurred the witness would report no unfavourable
results from long hours of labour, while those whose
main interest lay with the well-being of the worker
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>would notice any falling off in health with long
hours and would report accordingly. It is obvious
that no definite conclusions as to the immediate or
ultimate effect of long hours can be made from
evidence of this nature. In the second part of this
report suggestions will be made as to the lines on
which more scientific inquiry should be conducted
in order to determine the exact effects of varying
hours of industrial work on the physical organisation
of adolescent girls.</p>

<p><i>Protracted Standing and Opportunity for Rest.</i>&mdash;Evidence
as to the provision of seats in munition
factories is, on the whole, very encouraging. Most
workshops have stools or seats for use during the
short pauses which occur whilst waiting for materials
or for the setting of tools, and where possible younger
girls are put on work that can be done sitting down,
whilst Welfare supervisors are generally ready to
recommend that delicate girls be transferred from
work which involves protracted standing to processes
which allow occasional or even continued
sitting-down, and foremen are nearly always willing
to fall in with the Welfare Workers' suggestions.
Only in a few cases have there been difficulties in
securing seats: where men have been formerly
employed the foremen are sometimes prejudiced
against allowing girls to sit down, but they are
soon convinced of the wisdom of making this concession.</p>

<p>With certain processes prolonged standing is
inevitable, but evidence as to resulting injury was
not forthcoming in Birmingham or Coventry. None
of the doctors interviewed was able to make any
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>statement regarding the effects of a continued
standing posture, as no cases of injury that could
be attributed to this cause had come to their notice.
Some of the Welfare supervisors stated that girls
got very tired at first but soon got used to the
permanent standing, and that no serious or lasting
injuries resulted, though in a few cases girls not used
to industrial work would get flat-footed or would
suffer from swollen feet. While varicose veins are
rare in young girls, every witness brought into
contact with older married women was impressed
by the apparent inevitability of this trouble in later
years, but it is impossible to gather how far work
during adolescence is responsible.</p>

<p>Evidence as to the effects of standing on the
menstrual function will be discussed later.</p>

<p>From the evidence received it seems probable
that only a small proportion, and these perhaps the
more delicate, are troubled by prolonged standing,
but attention may be drawn to the evidence of one
large factory where 50 per cent of all new workers
leave before the end of six months, and of these
30 per cent declare that they find the standing so
fatiguing that they cannot remain at the work.</p>

<p>In most of the processes of the cotton and worsted
industries chances of resting are exceedingly rare.
Girls carrying laps<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> from the blowing-room to the
cards, can-tenters and drawing-frame minders in
the card-room, and winders and weavers, seldom,
if ever, get an opportunity to sit down. Girls on the
slubber, intermediate, and roving frames, and those
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>in the ring-room of the cotton trade and the spinning-rooms
of the worsted industry, are in a better position
in that a few minutes' rest is sometimes possible,
and some managers and overlookers believe that
these girls are less tired and show a better sickness
record than the former group. Even where the
nature of the work allows occasional periods of rest,
seats are scarcely ever provided, so that the girls
seldom sit down unless the waste-boxes or the skips
are in a suitable position so that they can see down
their frames to note if the work is proceeding all
right. Many of the witnesses stated complacently
that the girls soon got used to the prolonged standing,
but doctors noted that prolapsed wombs were not
uncommon in young women between 20 and 30,
though some felt that the number of cases were not
sufficient to warrant any conclusions. Sick Visitors
also reported that prolapse was not unusual, and
that most girls found the long hours of standing
very fatiguing. Cases of prolapse are sometimes
reported amongst young married women who have
not worked after marriage and who have had every
care after child-birth, which seems to point to an
adverse influence exerted during adolescence. Sometimes
girls complain bitterly of the lack of opportunity
for even a few minutes' rest, and the Sick
Visitors say that conditions of work which do not
allow a girl to snatch even a short respite during a
10-hour day do not give her a chance to get over
any constitutional delicacy. As a general rule,
however, the girls make no complaints, but older
women find the continued standing very tiring, and
many witnesses believe that this is due to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>cumulative strain of long years, while some declare
that the anaemia prevalent among young textile
workers is largely due to the weakened condition
brought about by long hours of standing.</p>

<p>Reference may be made here to the necessity
for attention to the type of seat provided, particularly
in entirely sedentary occupations, as in the
clothing trade and in many of the processes of such
industries as biscuit-making, soap-manufacturing,
etc. Witnesses from the clothing trade laid great
stress on the fact that sitting all day on a small
hard stool was extremely fatiguing for growing girls,
as it gave no support to their backs, and the Welfare
Worker of a large soap-works, after trying one of
the stools in her own office, is having them all
replaced by chairs with suitable backs in those
departments where the work is mainly sedentary.</p>

<p><i>Weight-carrying and Heavy Work.</i>&mdash;As far as one
can gather from the rather scanty evidence available
under this heading, girls under 16 in munition
works are seldom engaged on work involving heavy
lifting and carrying. The majority of young girls
are feeding automatic machines and working power
presses, and all materials are brought and taken
away by special labourers. Many girls over 16
have been substituted for men workers, but it is
exceedingly difficult to gauge the effect which such
work is exerting on their health. Overlookers and
Welfare supervisors declare that tall strong girls
are chosen for heavy processes and that very few
injuries result, while a girl can be transferred to
lighter work if the heavy work is too fatiguing.
One doctor related how she had just concluded the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>examination of 200 women and girls engaged on
heavy capstan lathes and had discovered no injurious
effects, but she pointed out that they were all from
the Black Country, where women and girls have
been doing heavy work for several generations, and
their physique was undoubtedly superior to that of
the average industrial girl worker. Another doctor
stated that the carrying of weights over 50 lbs. is
exceedingly injurious to adolescent girls, as it
causes the heart to beat too quickly, so that after
a time the beat is continuously rapid and anaemia
sets in. This effect is seldom, if ever, noticed in
girls over 20. On the other hand, uterine injuries
are practically unknown in young girls and hernia
is very rare.</p>

<p>In one large works the girls who are transferred
to men's work of lifting and carrying goods are
selected by the gymnasium mistress and wear gymnastic
costumes to facilitate their movements, and the
works doctor reports that there have been no ill effects
beyond a few cases of sprained ankles and wrists.</p>

<p>By an agreement between the Master Cotton
Spinners and the Card and Blowing Room Amalgamation,
which was signed in February 1917,
women and girls are allowed to break off laps from
openers and scutchers provided they do not exceed
45 lbs. in weight, and also to fetch these from the
blowing-room on lap-trams and put them on the
cards. In Leigh, Wigan, and other districts where
Trade Unionism is weak, girls have been employed
at this work for a long time prior to the agreement,
and the laps are seldom moved on lap-trams but
are carried on the girl's shoulder. Some overlookers
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>said that they had always tried to get tall strong
girls for lap-carrying, as the laps, though seldom
very heavy&mdash;average weight 32&ndash;42 lbs.&mdash;are very
cumbersome to manipulate, and that such girls
never experienced any difficulty in carrying the
laps. Where this care is not exercised (and it is to
be feared that in the majority of cases no regard is
paid to the girl's capacity for the work) difficulty in
manipulating the bulky lap may be experienced by
small girls.</p>

<p>Can-tenting on the cards is an easy or fatiguing
occupation according as the cans are made of fibre
or of tin. When the latter are in use girls get very
tired, as they are continually dragging the cans,
three or four at a time, from the cards to the drawing-frames,
which are often some distance away. The
secretary of one branch of the Card Room Amalgamation
expressed the opinion that the use of fibre-cans
ought to be compulsory, as the improvement in
physical condition when these are introduced is
quite remarkable. But in view of the fact that
whenever cans are being renewed fibre ones invariably
replace the old-fashioned tin cans, legislation
seems unnecessary, and in many places where tin
cans are still in use trams are used to convey them
to the drawing-frames.</p>

<p>At the present time girls are frequently seen
dragging skips of cops and bobbins from one room
to another or on to the hoist. In well-managed mills
the skips are moved on lines, or else are furnished
with wheels, but sometimes cases are reported of
girls getting ruptured through pulling skips without
wheels up sloping floors.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span></p>
<p>In most weaving sheds&mdash;cotton and worsted&mdash;the
weavers' work is to fetch the tins of weft, keep
the shuttles full, repair broken threads, and carry
the finished pieces or cuts to the warehouse. The
actual process of weaving does not involve any
heavy work, and fetching the cops of weft is only
fatiguing when heavy tins have to be brought from
the cellars, which is not usual. But the dangerous
element in the work is the occasional necessity of
altering the weights, which are placed by the overlooker
on levers at the back of the loom, to maintain
the required tension of the warp. Many witnesses,
Trade Union officials, doctors, overlookers, employers,
and technical schoolmasters bore testimony
to the risk of internal strain and hernia which
attends the manipulation of these weighted levers.
A broad loom for the manufacture of cotton sheetings
or worsted cloths may have two or three 56-lb.
weights on both levers, while for lighter fabrics two
32-lb. weights on each side are quite common. In
most sheds the space between the looms is so
restricted that the weavers have to move the weights
in the position of maximum disadvantage. As a
matter of fact the actual number of cases of rupture
and other injuries is very small. Many witnesses
said it was a cause of perennial amazement to them
that this should be so, but some Sick Visitors and
Trade Union secretaries said that not all the cases
came to their official notice, as girls are often too
reticent to claim compensation for internal injuries.
Other witnesses recorded their conviction that the
effect of the risk was seen better in the gradual
strain and the deterioration in health than in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>few cases where actual injury results. It must be
remarked here that men weavers are often willing
to help women and girls with this lifting of the
weights, but as a general rule the girls are too
independent to ask for the help, and the competition
and speeding up are so intense that they will not
take up the time of a fellow-weaver. There are a
number of patent weighting motions on the market
whose object is to dispense with heavy weights, a
9-lb. weight being sufficient for any ordinary warp,
so that a young person can roll back the yarn on
the beam after unweaving or pulling back equally
with the strongest man. Many witnesses considered
that legislation ought to be introduced
making such contrivances compulsory, and it is
interesting to note that some employers who had
tried these patents on a few looms intend to introduce
them altogether when the war is over, and some
have found that by selling the old weights they have
been able to install patent weighting motions at a
very small cost per loom.</p>

<p>Carrying finished pieces to the warehouse is an
advantage to the weavers in so far as it breaks the
monotony of the work, but where the cloth is heavy
it is very tiring, particularly for short weavers, as
lifting the bundle over the loom-end in the narrow
alley is exceedingly fatiguing. In the worsted
industry most pieces weigh 100 lbs., and two girls
are said to carry one piece to the warehouse. Cotton
goods seldom reach this weight, but in many districts
the trade is becoming heavier, and 60 lbs. is not unusual,
and girls will carry such a piece without any
help. Most witnesses insisted that cut carriers
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>ought to be employed, as they are in a few places,
where heavy cloth and broad pieces are woven;
even though few cases of serious injury can be
attributed to this cause, girls at work on heavy goods
and broad looms are "off sick" more frequently
than other weavers.</p>

<p><i>Peculiar Movements.</i>&mdash;The points to be considered
under this heading were included in the
investigation as it was felt that movements involving
continued use of one foot, while the full
weight rested on the other, as in working a treadle,
or frequent stretching might exert a harmful effect
during adolescence, whilst they might be quite
innocuous for adults. The evidence, however, is
too scanty to warrant any conclusion, as work of
this character is much less general than formerly.
On some of the machines used in engineering girls
have either to work a foot lever continuously or to
start and stop the motion, but where Welfare Workers
and nurses are in charge they frequently arrange
that girls be transferred to other work after a time,
so they have nothing to report as to the effects of
the work. The doctor at one large factory considers
that such work causes trouble with womb and bowels
and may lead to prolapse, and that it is likely to
weaken the abdominal muscles, but she had no
definite evidence from girls under her supervision
as she had insisted some time previously that girls
should only do pedal work on alternate days, so that
now they are engaged on another process in the same
room every other day. She was, however, able to
report that, previous to the enforcement of this
arrangement, many girls working treadle machines
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>would go home during their menstrual periods, and
now very few feel the need to do this.</p>

<p>In some of the card-room processes, particularly
on the intermediate frames, also in the ring spinning-room,
and at worsted spinning, short girls have much
stretching to reach the top rows of bobbins, but
though this is tiring no special injurious effects are
recorded. The difficulties of stretching movements
are further intensified in the case of preparation
work on drawing-boxes in the worsted industry, as
girls have to lift large bobbins weighing about
28 to 30 lbs. into creels above their heads; but though
some witnesses declared that this was very tiring,
no evidence as to actual effects could be secured.
A Trade Union delegate mentioned that some girls
on this work have broken down completely, and
have been forbidden by their doctors to return to
the work&mdash;the effect showing itself in a rapid deterioration
in general health rather than in actual
injury. Further inquiry, however, brought out the
fact that the majority of workers on this process
are over 20 years of age, and are therefore outside
the scope of this investigation.</p>

<p><i>Sanitary Conditions.</i>&mdash;Reports as to sanitary accommodation
in factories are generally satisfactory,
thanks to the untiring efforts of the Women Factory
Inspectors. In Birmingham, with its multiplicity
of small workshops, however, conditions, to put it
mildly, are not always ideal. As one doctor remarked,
"Things are not so bad as to allow closing
down of workrooms, but the sanitary arrangements
often fall short of a reasonable standard of decency,
though the competition with large firms is having a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>salutary effect." The only complaints that were
brought to my notice referred to inadequate ventilation
and lighting and the objectionable system of
"timing." The former is generally remedied with
the advent of the Welfare supervisor, the latter
complaint appears to be quite general in Coventry
and is the cause of much discomfort and annoyance.
Where a large number of girls are employed the
temptation to remain away from the workshop for
long periods, playing in the lavatories, appears to
be very general among younger girls. One cannot
help feeling that the difficulty can be overcome by
arranging for a woman attendant to take charge of
lavatories and cloak-rooms, rather than by a system
which runs counter to all decent instincts. Welfare
Workers report that where such attendants are
employed the behaviour of young girls seldom gives
cause for complaint. In a few factories the attendants
in charge of the lavatories supply sanitary
towels at 1d. or &frac12;d. each, a practice which might
be universally adopted.</p>

<p>The sanitary arrangements in textile mills are
not always adequate, though few are reported as
actually unsatisfactory. Pail closets are, however,
still present in a fair proportion of the older mills.
The chief complaint, particularly in reference to the
needs of adolescent girls, concerns the position of
the closets; in most mills the male and female
conveniences are next to each other, and witnesses
report that young girls are frequently too shy to
make use of them, especially in weaving-sheds
where the doors of the closets are in view of all.
Much unnecessary suffering therefore results, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>girls sometimes turn ill from this cause. These
witnesses recommend that the sanitary conveniences
be placed outside the sheds, and that male and
female accommodation be in different parts of the
mills. It may be noted in passing that this difficulty
was only represented in north-east Lancashire,
where the social position of the operatives is generally
somewhat superior to those of other districts,
and where reticence in such matters is more likely
to be intensified.</p>

<p>Lighting and ventilation of closets is frequently
faulty, and stress must be laid on the necessity
for washing facilities, generally entirely lacking in
textile factories.</p>

<p><i>Meals.</i>&mdash;Attention has been drawn in the section
devoted to hours to the value of good feeding in
mitigating the injurious effects of long hours of
labour. It must be remembered that the evidence
from the engineering industry was collected towards
the end of 1916, so that the reports refer to the
period before the increase in food prices had balanced
the rise in wages. It seems to be fairly established
that where good wages are earned adequate food is
eaten, though one or two observers reported that
girls are still eating unsuitable food, with the result
that gastric troubles are common. As a general
rule, however, particularly where canteens have
been set up, good meat dinners are eaten, and the
girls appear to be well nourished. Welfare Workers
report on the improvement in health which follows
the opening of canteens, and they note especially
how anaemia is reduced. Inquiries by club secretaries
and the experience of district nurses who visit
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>working-class households show that improved feeding
invariably follows an increase in wages. As one
witness says, "If they have the money they eat
good food, and once in the habit they do not easily
fall back." This is encouraging in face of the widespread
belief that girls are careless about their food
and willingly live on tea and bread. The only
complaints concern the lack of variety in the food
provided in the canteens. One Welfare supervisor
lays great stress on the value of a long dinner-hour,
and she attributes the absence of digestive troubles
at her factory to the hour and a half allowed at
midday.<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></p>

<p>One witness pointed out that when work starts
at 8 <span class="smcap">A.M.</span> many girls get no breakfast, and when
dinner-time comes at 12 or 12.30 they do not feel
able to eat ordinary food and take only bread and
tea, or something "tasty," but not nourishing.
This point should be borne in mind when the
arrangement of hours is under discussion, especially
in view of the suggestion of one doctor who thought
that the ideal working-day when long hours are
necessary for output, would be from 7 <span class="smcap">A.M.</span> to 12
and 1 <span class="smcap">P.M.</span> to 6 <span class="smcap">P.M.</span>, with ten minutes break for tea,
etc., in the middle of each spell. His reason for
opposing an earlier start with a breakfast interval
at 8 o'clock depended on the fact that the earlier
spell (6 <span class="smcap">A.M.</span>&ndash;8 <span class="smcap">A.M.</span>) would probably be worked
fasting, which he considered to be very injurious.
How much more harmful then must be a whole morning's
work with only a very light refreshment at the
interval. The Sick Visitor of the United Garment
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>Workers' Union at Hebden Bridge also draws
attention to the difficulty of obtaining an adequate
breakfast at 7 o'clock in time for the 7.30 <span class="smcap">A.M.</span> start
general at Hebden Bridge, and she attributes the
prevalent trouble of indigestion to this cause.</p>

<p>In the textile industries such amenities as dining-rooms
are practically unknown. A benevolent employer
here and there, or a Co-operative Wholesale
Society, may provide a canteen, but such examples
are exceedingly rare. In south-east Lancashire
most operatives who work at a distance from their
homes arrange with a family in the neighbourhood
of the mill to provide them with hot water for tea,
and possibly to cook some food for them, for breakfast
and dinner. Those who do not do this take
their meals in the mill, and as seats are non-existent
they have to sit on skips or on the floor. When one
realises the atmospheric conditions of most mills,
the heat, the damp resulting from steaming, to say
nothing of the smell from oil and size, one cannot
imagine a worse arrangement. In north Lancashire
conditions are somewhat better in that most mills
provide hot water for tea at a charge of 1d. or 2d.
per week, and a certain few provide ovens for heating
food, but here again the meals have to be taken in
the vitiated atmosphere of the mill. Practically
all operatives remain at the mill for their breakfast,
but the majority go home to dinner. The standard
of living is high, but too much carbo-hydrate and
too little protein food is general; bread and tea,
chips and fish (mostly batter), and cakes and pasties,
and potato pie with very little meat, form the staple
diet. Doctors especially remark on this, and they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>attribute the distaste for nourishing food to the
long hours of confinement in the close atmosphere
of the mill. Industrial employment of the mothers
is also held to be responsible for faulty feeding, and
when the mother leaves the mill to look after the
needs of a large family the taste for unsuitable food
is settled, and the diet continues as before.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">General Effects of Industry on Physical
Condition</span></h3>

<p>In addition to the influence of these special
considerations on the health of girls in factory
employment, certain ailments and forms of physical
disability which may not of themselves be immediately
incapacitating may be induced by the
general unfavourable environment of industrial life
Amongst such disorders may be classed:</p>


<ol><li>Anaemia.</li>
<li>Gastric disorders.</li>
<li>Nervous affections.</li>
<li>Disturbances of menstrual function.</li>
</ol>

<p>Growing girls are particularly liable to these
disorders, so that their extent was made the subject
of special inquiry.</p>

<p><i>Anaemia.</i>&mdash;The absence of an absolute standard
and complete lack of statistical information render
the evidence under this heading vague and inconclusive.
Most of the Welfare Workers in the various
munition factories visited stated that very few
girls suffer from anaemia; two or three stated that
many girls were anaemic when they started their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>industrial life, but that after a short time, thanks,
as they believed, to better feeding and a regular life,
the disorder passed off. On the other hand, the
doctors and club workers interviewed were confident
that the long hours worked were increasing the
proportion of anaemic girls. One doctor, when recording
the prevalence of anaemia among industrially
employed girls, attributed it to the fatigue following
inadequate rest, coupled in many cases with excessive
menstruation, due similarly to the fatigue of long
hours. There was considerable divergence of opinion
as to the age incidence of anaemia, some observers
stating that the period immediately following the
taking up of employment, 14 to 16, showed the
worst record, whilst others found the years 16 to
20 were responsible for most of the anaemia. It
is interesting to note that some of the Coventry
witnesses found anaemia much reduced since the
War, no doubt as a result of the better feeding, and
one Welfare Worker stated that only those girls
who were found to be eating insufficient food or
who came from long distances without breakfast
suffered in this way.</p>

<p>The textile industry presents a more uniform
picture, and there is much evidence to show that a
large proportion of the girls employed in the cotton
and the worsted trades suffer excessively from this
disorder. Some observers state that many girls
are anaemic about the age of 12 when they start
work, and then again between 18 and 22; others
declare that most girls suffer from anaemia at some
time between the ages of 13 and 18. As far as the
actual sickness returns of the Trade Union Insurance
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>Societies are concerned, it appears that anaemia is
more frequent after 21 than before, but these refer
to anaemia of such severity that absence from work
is necessary, and the Sick Visitors say that many
girls under 21 suffer from anaemia for lengthy periods
without medical attention or sickness pay.</p>

<p>Doctors are inclined to attribute the excessive
anaemia to the fatigue of long hours of labour in a
close atmosphere, continued standing, insufficient
sleep due to the early morning start, and faulty
feeding.</p>

<p>The sedentary nature of the clothing industry
renders the girls very liable to anaemia, and though
the employers frequently deny this, the evidence
from the Trade Union Secretaries and the Sick
Visitors with their actual record of cases outweighs
the observations of the employers. Witnesses from
girls' clubs and evening classes often state that the
clothing trade is responsible for a higher proportion
of anaemic girls than any other industry.</p>

<p><i>Gastric Disorders.</i>&mdash;Most witnesses report that
indigestion and other gastric disorders are general
among girls, though it is often noted that men and
older women suffer more frequently from these
complaints. Seldom is the actual work held to be
responsible. Girls working with powder in munition
factories or where the smell of oil is disagreeable
appear to be more liable than others, and weavers
who are taller than the average&mdash;only a small proportion&mdash;find
the constant bending over the loom
aggravates a tendency to indigestion, but beyond
these few cases faulty and irregular feeding seems
to be the main cause for the prevalent gastric
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>troubles. It is interesting to note that hygiene and
physiology classes are doing much to inculcate sound
notions of diet, which, taken in conjunction with
increased wages and easy accessibility of food in
canteens, are doing much to prevent gastric disorders.
Irregular and hurried feeding depends
mainly on the arrangement of hours of labour, and
can only be overcome when these are based on more
rational lines. One Welfare Worker records a very
small proportion of digestive troubles, and this she
attributes to the hour and a half allowed for the
midday meal.<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></p>

<p>Where work starts at 7.30, as in the clothing
trade at Hebden Bridge, many girls take only a cup
of tea or a piece of bread before commencing work,
and then have to wait until 12.30 before they can
get a proper meal. Doctors point out how the
long hours of labour in the close atmosphere of mills
and factories engender a poor appetite, so that
nourishing food becomes distasteful, and tea and
confectionery frequently form the staple diet, with
disastrous results to the digestive functions.</p>

<p><i>Headaches.</i>&mdash;Headaches appear to be extremely
common amongst girls in all the industries reviewed,
the reasons advanced to account for this being
variously the noise of machinery, the smell of oil
and size, inadequate ventilation, and eye-strain
consequent on close attention to the work.</p>

<p>Ventilation is notoriously bad in those factories
where previously only men were employed, but new
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>and large factories, particularly where there is a
Welfare Worker, show much improvement, and
under such conditions headaches are said to be rare.
Defective eyesight is a frequent cause of headaches,
and here again a careful Welfare supervisor can do
much good by advising a visit to the optician or
eye hospital. Clothing operatives are especially
liable to eye-strain, and care in lighting arrangements
is very necessary. Mending in the worsted industry
is also trying for the eyes. In one large mill visited
a superior woman overlooker was in charge of the
mending and burling, and she was careful to vary
the work so that the tedious pieces did not always
come to the same girls. By this means, and by the
use of eye-shades to keep off the glare of the light,
she finds headaches can be largely prevented. It
is to be feared that such care is not general in the
industry, as a Trade Union representative reports
that headaches are very common.</p>

<p><i>Nervous Disorders.</i>&mdash;The evidence here is extremely
scanty. One doctor drew attention to the
danger of automatism. When very monotonous and
restricted movements are employed, a whole room
of girls may become nervous and hysterical. He
has known this to occur in the making of nails,
where the difference between the various processes
is so slight that the monotony cannot be obviated
by periodically transferring the girls to different
kinds of work. Two other witnesses drew attention
to the effect of piece-work at high pressure in causing
a tendency to hysteria and other nerve disorders,
and doffing in the worsted spinning rooms is said
to be responsible for the noisy excitability which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>is so marked among the younger boys and girls.
The more common experience, however, is the
absence of nervous disorders among industrially
employed girls. Various doctors in Lancashire and
Welfare Workers and others in Birmingham and
Coventry commented on this, and recorded their
conviction that the social influences at work, cheerful
companionship and an increased interest in life, are
powerful antidotes to possible nervous afflictions.</p>

<p><i>Menstrual Disorders.</i>&mdash;As far as can be ascertained
from an inquiry based on the general experiences
of persons in touch with girls either inside
or outside the factory, the extent of menstrual disorders
appears to be much slighter than is generally
supposed. In most of the non-textile industries
reviewed, opportunities for sitting down were fairly
general, and here painful or excessive menstruation
was exceedingly rare. Nurses in charge of rest-rooms
and surgeries report that only a small proportion
of girls are troubled in any way, and those
who make use of the rest-rooms during their periods
are always the same ones each month, so it may be
presumed that these are constitutionally delicate,
and that the work is not responsible for their disorder.
Doctors declare that if the general health
is good, industrial work for a reasonable number of
hours has no ill-effects, but, on the contrary, the
active movements involved are a positive advantage.
When, however, the hours worked are so long as to
cause extreme fatigue, excessive and painful menstruation
frequently results. Nurses and Welfare
Workers notice that many girls of 14 have not
commenced their menstrual periods when they start
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>work, and they point out that the active life and
the chance of good nourishment which wage-earning
ensures has a good effect in bringing on normal
periods.</p>

<p>Some witnesses report that girls who have no
opportunity of sitting down suffer much pain during
menstruation and get very fatigued, but the evidence
on this point was not unanimous.</p>

<p>Evidence from the textile industry is not so
satisfactory. As was pointed out when the provision
of seats was under discussion, cotton and
worsted factories are lamentably behind other industries
in this respect, and as hours are uniformly
10 per day and the pressure of work generally very
considerable, it is not surprising that menstrual
disorders are reported more frequently than in non-textile
trades. It must also be remembered that the
large majority of textile operatives start work at 12 or
13 years of age, just at the onset of puberty, while in
other industries 14 is the general school-leaving age.</p>

<p>Many girls find the long hours of continued
standing very tiring during menstruation, and as
these factors conduce to anaemia, failure of the
menses and dysmenorrhoea are more common than
in other industries.</p>

<p>Most witnesses laid stress on the need for seats
and rest-rooms in textile factories as a means of
preventing painful menstruation; in many mills
girls are not even allowed to snatch a few minutes'
rest by sitting on the waste-boxes or on straps slung
between their looms, and they frequently experience
difficulty in getting permission to go home when
feeling unwell unless they can get a substitute.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>Two men overlookers drew attention to the
advantage which results when the foremen and
overlookers are married, as they are then more
sympathetic about periodical lost-time and are more
willing to allow girls to go home at the half-day.</p>

<p>But the doctors interviewed are unable to attribute
any permanent menstrual disorders or resultant
injuries to these causes, and they are inclined to
believe that the active life of the mill is a help
rather than a hindrance to the menstrual function.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Realisation of the Needs of Adolescents</span></h3>

<p>Any realisation of the particular problems and
needs of adolescents by attempts to fit work to their
physical capacity is so rare that the few cases where
such provisions are made stand out in marked
contrast. In munition and other factories where
Welfare Workers are in charge, efforts are generally
made to limit overtime and night work to those
over 18, but at the time the inquiry was made in
Birmingham and Coventry girls over 16 were in
most cases expected to take their turn at night work
with the older workers, while in some factories, after
the first few weeks' probationary period is over,
old and young alike have to work on the alternate
night and day shifts, although it is now generally
acknowledged that night work is more detrimental
for young than for adult workers. At one of the
larger factories visited, girls under 16 always stop
work at 6 <span class="smcap">P.M.</span> after a 9&frac34;-hour day, while those over
16 work another hour, and when overtime is being
worked, another two hours. At another factory
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>all the girls under 18 were engaged on light sedentary
work for 42 hours per week, while the heavy work
on presses and capstan lathes was done by girls
and women over 18 for 53 hours. In some works
the majority of the younger workers are on light
work, such as "examining," and in others the foremen
are willing to transfer girls from work they find
specially fatiguing, on the recommendation of the
Welfare Worker. This, however, is not general, and
few foremen exercise care in the selection of girls
for heavy processes. As one witness pointed out,
girls are chosen for their bright and intelligent
appearance, with little attention to physical capacity.</p>

<p>In the cotton industry the position is even worse.
Girls entering the mill at 12 as half-timers or at 13
for full time are expected to conform in every way
to factory life. Voluntary reduction of hours by
employers for younger workers is completely unknown,
and instead of suiting the work to the
capacity of young workers, the girls have to adapt
themselves to the requirements of their work. As
soon as a girl has her own looms&mdash;at the present time
weavers are on two looms at 13, and frequently on
four at 14 or 15&mdash;the manager expects her to produce
the average output every week, and the strain to
do this is responsible for much deterioration in
health. The competition between weavers is encouraged
by overlookers and managers, and no effort
is ever made to teach girls to conserve their energies.</p>

<p>In the worsted industry the majority of the
younger workers are employed in the spinning rooms,
first as doffers and then as spinners, which one
witness describes as the hardest process in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>industry. Few girls remain at spinning after they
are 18, as the money earned here seldom exceeds
18s. per week, but it is during the critical years of
adolescence that they are engaged on this exceedingly
fatiguing work, and no effort is made to reduce
the burden of their employment.</p>

<p>In the clothing trade of Hebden Bridge the
Trade Union officials report that the younger workers
are not subjected to heavy pressure of work, and are
able to take their ease at the workshops if they so
desire, the peculiar circumstances of the trade here
preventing any attempt to speed them up by threat
of dismissal. In one or two factories learners and
young operatives work in a separate room in charge
of women overlookers, and in most cases these supervisors
are careful about the health of their charges
and prevent them working at an excessive pace.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">The Transition from School to Factory Life</span></h3>

<p>In reviewing the effects of the transition from
school to factory life it must be remembered that
the evidence from the non-textile industries refers
to girls who are over 14 years of age, while in the
textile towns the large majority of the children start
work either as half-timers at 12 or as full timers
at 13. The general trend of the evidence shows
that the taking up of non-textile employment is
attended by a considerable falling-off in health.
Most girls become thinner and lose their colour and
vitality during their first six months at the factory,
and those working long hours become "like machines,
able to keep on without breakdown, but lose all
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>their normal interests." This, however, appears
to pass off after a time, and their health and vitality
return.</p>

<p>Some witnesses had noticed that the usual manifestations
of lessened vitality and anaemia were not
so general as in pre-war days, and this is naturally
attributed to the better feeding and consideration
obtainable at the present time. My attention was
drawn several times to the desirability of increased
care during the critical years of early adolescence
through an extension of the medical service under
the National Insurance Act to all industrially employed
persons. Some Welfare Workers found that
constant attention was needed to prevent a widespread
deterioration in health during the first period
of employment, and their efforts were frequently
hampered by lack of facilities for medical attention.</p>

<p>Some witnesses, notably those from the Hebden
Bridge clothing trade, as well as from some of the
miscellaneous trades investigated, state that girls
are put to easier and lighter work when they first
leave school and that they take their ease at it, so
that no falling-off in health accompanies the transition
stage, but a deterioration in physique with
increased sickness shows itself at 16 or 17, when they
begin to work at a high pressure.</p>

<p>The special problem of half-time labour in the
cotton and worsted industries, dealing as it does
with the employment of children as distinct from
adolescents, does not concern us here, so that we
will review only the taking up of full-time employment
at 13. Where girls come straight from 6
hours' work at school to the full working-day of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>10 hours the change involves a considerable strain,
even when, as tenters and learners, they are not
worked hard. Opinions vary as to the stress of
work during the first few months of employment,
some witnesses declaring that the children take their
ease at first. This may be the case when they are
earning a time-wage as back-tenters in the card room
or as tenters in the weaving shed, provided they
are working for kindly, considerate persons, but
where they are put on piece-work the more general
opinion is that the anxiety for earnings is as strong
an incentive to young as to adult workers, and that
all alike work at top speed. These witnesses lay
stress on the inevitable deterioration which sets in
at this time, and they attribute it mainly to the
strain of factory life coming at the same time as the
onset of puberty. This opinion is reinforced by
the examples often quoted of girls who have not
taken up industrial work until 15 or 16; these soon
settle down without any falling-off in health. The
comparison between girls who go to the mills at
13 and those who go to the secondary schools is
even more striking. In most of the cotton towns,
particularly in north-east Lancashire, the majority
of the pupils at the secondary schools are drawn
from the same class and come from the same type of
homes as the girls who go to the mills, so that the
different circumstances of their lives after they
leave the elementary schools must be responsible
for the differences in health and physique which
are so marked at this period.</p>

<p>Many witnesses were of the opinion that the
certifying factory surgeons are not careful enough
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>in excluding girls from the factories, so that many
delicate girls work at the mills who might grow out
of their weakness in a more favourable environment.
If the surgeons were able to postpone admission to
the factory for varying periods much deterioration
might be avoided.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Special Problems</span></h3>

<p><i>Girls in the Mule Rooms.</i>&mdash;The shortage of boy
labour in the spinning branch of the cotton industry
has led during recent years to a revival of the old
custom of employing women and girls in the mule
rooms. In strongly organised districts this means
that girls are being engaged as piecers in increasing
numbers, while where Trade Union organisation is
weak, outside the great spinning areas, as in Wigan,
they are frequently acting as mule minders. As
might be expected, the influence of war conditions
has been to intensify this shortage of boy labour
and to increase the number of female piecers, so
that the Bolton Operative Cotton Spinners' Association
finds that no fewer than 1163 additional girl
piecers have been brought into the mule rooms in
their district since the outbreak of war, making a
total of 3315. The increase will be proportional in
Oldham and district.</p>

<p>In this inquiry the evidence as to the effects of
such work was drawn entirely from non-medical
sources, as it was impossible to get definite medical
experience of the problem. Consequently the conclusions
are more general than exact. Many employers
and overlookers and some Trade Union
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>witnesses were firmly of the opinion that mule-room
work exerted no injurious influence on the health
of girls, but it must be noted that these witnesses
were drawn entirely from Wigan and Leigh, where
the proximity of coal-mines with the attraction of
higher wages absorbs most of the available boy
labour, so that the shortage has been acute for some
years, and the witnesses have got so accustomed to
the presence of girls in the mule rooms that they
can see nothing against it. All the more striking,
therefore, is the testimony of some overlookers in
these districts who declared that the work made
girls thin, weak-chested, and anaemic. The temperature
of the mule room frequently exceeds 90°F.
and girls and men work in very scanty clothing,
and the liability to colds on leaving the overheated
atmosphere is very marked. Girls are on their feet
the whole day, with no opportunity for rest, and by
the end of the day they have walked many miles.
One witness said that girls get very tired, but that
no permanent ill-effects are noticed; but he advocated
that rest-rooms be provided in order to prevent
undue fatigue. More than one mule-room overlooker
declared that no daughter of his should ever
work in the spinning room, and the opposition to
such work was based on physical as well as on moral
grounds. One manager pointed out that "wiping
down" the mule is particularly "nasty work" for
girls: every two hours or so the little piecer has to
run down the mule under the ends and clean with
both hands as she runs, and this has to be done with
great speed, as the spinners object to the mules
being stopped for more than a minute or so.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span></p>
<p>A small meeting of mule-room women workers,
joint minders, and piecers whom I interviewed were
very resentful that their work should be considered
harmful, probably from fear of losing their employment,
so it was difficult to get any definite evidence.
The only reform for which they pressed dealt with
the provision of cloak-rooms where men and women
work together. As mentioned above, the heat is so
intense that very little clothing is worn&mdash;men wear
a pair of linen drawers and a shirt, the women and
girls frequently only a skirt and blouse; and they
dress and undress in sight of one another. The
moral effects of mule-room work are outside the
scope of this investigation, but attention must be
drawn in passing to the undesirable position occasioned
by the heat, the scanty clothing, the attitudes
necessary for the work, and the subordination of
women and girls to the male minders in an unhealthy
atmosphere. In Wigan, where women minders or
joiner-minders are the rule, these moral objections
seldom occur.</p>

<p>Witnesses from mills that do not employ girls in
mule-room work were very insistent on the objectionable
moral and physical effects of such work, agreeing
with Mr. James Haslam that it makes girls "sallow
and tired, crooked in limbs, bloodless and dyspeptic."<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a></p>

<p><i>Speeding up.</i>&mdash;We have already referred to the
driving effect of piece-work on simple automatic processes,
but it is difficult to deduce any definite conclusions
from the evidence of the non-textile industries.
Thus some Welfare Workers and employers say that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>the girls take full advantage of the liberty allowed
them, and are frequently to be seen wandering into
other rooms and workshops for conversations with
their friends. This seems to contradict the view
that anxiety to earn a good wage causes excessive
speeding up, but other witnesses find that the incentive
to increase output which piece-wages provide
is so strong that girls will not make use of rest-pauses
when these are allowed, and sometimes consequently
become exceedingly nervous. The pace
is set by the quickest workers, and the effort to
keep up is very wearying to weaker and slower
girls, who will not sit down or rest even when seats
are provided. Some interesting observations were
made by the director of a factory employing about
a thousand female workers. He has found that
continuous piece-work on simple processes has a
cramping mental effect, so that the girls become
perfect machines. Thus young women who have
been in the works for about six years will not face
the responsibility of an overlooker's position, and
seem to have no interests outside their output and
their wages. On the other hand, a small proportion
of the workers do not work at top speed if they can
get a moderate wage which seems to supply their
ordinary needs. Some girls previously earning 16s.
per week on piece-work are still getting the same
money, although they now get 3s. or 4s. war bonus,
plus their piece-earnings.</p>

<p>Speeding up of the machinery in the cotton
industry has been very marked during recent years.
In each department unremitting attention is necessary
if even a moderate wage is desired. The standard
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>of comfort is higher in Lancashire than in any other
industrial district, and a good family income is
considered essential. Consequently children and
young persons are just as keen on their output as
adult workers. Some witnesses pointed out that
doffers and back-tenters and other beginners who
are paid a time-wage are saved from the excessive
speeding up which results from piece-wages, and
that they get time to sit down and rest in the intervals
of doffing, etc. But any one who has watched the
gang of doffers passing from frame to frame in the
ring spinning rooms of the cotton industry or at
fly or cap spinning in the worsted trade will be
inclined to disagree with this view; and indeed the
textile master at the technical schools of one of the
West Riding worsted centres said that doffing was
done at top speed amid deafening noise, so that the
work was more fatiguing than any other occupation
in the mill.</p>

<p>Weavers and winders suffer from increased speed
as much as the card- and spinning-room workers.
Attention has been drawn to the spirit of competition
which managers and overlookers encourage between
weaver and weaver. Boys and girls, men and
women, are indirectly set to emulate each other.
Some witnesses believe that women and girls work
at higher pressure than men and boys, and since the
former invariably have domestic work when the
factory day is over, the strain is considerably increased.
At the present time girls are given responsible
work before they are equal for it. Teachers
frequently find half-time scholars, who have not
been at the mill more than a couple of months,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>announcing that they were working "for sick," that
is, minding the looms for a weaver who is away ill.
Such girls will get two looms of their own before
they are on full time, and at 14 they have four
looms under their charge. It was no uncommon
thing in north-east Lancashire to find that girls
have been working their mother's four looms for
some months while the mothers are minding the
soldier father's six looms. In some cases girls of
16 have six looms, and Sick Visitors report that
cases of heart trouble, anaemia, and general weakness
are most common at the present time amongst these
girls; "the possible lasting effects of this severe
strain are terrible to contemplate." The Sick
Visitors of another Union say that the falling-off in
health which is marked in adolescent workers, shows
itself most when the girl is put on to three looms.
Even in normal times girls mind three looms at 16,
and the strain is considerable. These witnesses
believe that the average girl should not be in charge
of three looms until she is 18, and that 21 is soon
enough for four looms. In this connection the
evidence of one large mill where the quality of the
weaving is above the average is particularly instructive.
The manager reported that the standard
of health was extremely satisfactory, and he pointed
out that girls are not allowed to take three or four
looms until they are strong and capable enough to
manage them, and he had found by experience that
it is seldom advisable to put them on the full number
of looms until 17 or 18.</p>

<h2>RECOMMENDATIONS</h2>


<p>The greater part of the evidence considered in this
report was based on opinions derived from personal
observations with very little scientific and no
statistical groundwork. The complete report leaves
us with a fairly accurate picture of the conditions
under which a large proportion of the adolescent
workers of the country are employed, with some
general notions as to how these conditions react on
their health and physique. Exact conclusions as
to the particular effects of the conditions of labour
cannot be obtained, as no records dealing with the
health of girls in factories are in existence. The
impossibility of securing scientific and reliable data
was apparent at an early stage of the inquiry, but
it was felt that by reviewing the conditions of
adolescent labour and by noting general tendencies
the way might be cleared for further investigation
on a more scientific basis.</p>

<p>It is now generally recognised that "fatigue has
a larger share in the promotion and permission of
disease than any other causal condition," and as
adolescents need a sufficient reserve of energy to
maintain growth as well as health, it is obvious that
conditions of work that exert no injurious effect on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>adults may be unduly fatiguing for juvenile workers
with their twofold need. Consequently the best
criterion for judging the effects of industry on the
health of adolescent girls will be based on observations
as to the incidence of fatigue with different
industrial occupations.</p>

<p>The presence of fatigue among girl workers has
been frequently noted in the course of the investigation,
but in every case the evidence is deduced merely
from the observations of those in contact with the
girls or from the testimony of the girls themselves.
Physiological research has conclusively proved that
subjective sensations are not a measure or even an
early sign of fatigue, and that real or objective
fatigue is shown and is measurable only by the
diminished capacity for performing the act that
caused it. Considerable attention has been devoted
to the subject of industrial fatigue during recent
years, and various tests for the detection of latent
fatigue have been employed. Measurement of the
output of work gives the most direct test of fatigue
provided allowance is made for all variable factors
except the worker's changing capacity. In addition,
the observation of certain secondary symptoms supplies
a useful index to the degree of fatigue which
work induces. Lack of co-ordination, one of the
earliest manifestations of nervous fatigue, results in
increased accidents. The accident rate in factories
tends to be 25 to 55 per cent higher for boys and
girls than for men and women. In 1912 there were
4914 accidents to female young persons in factories
and workshops.<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> Much light might be thrown on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>the presence of fatigue amongst industrially employed
girls by records of the accident rates in
factories, corrected with reference to the hours and
conditions of labour and to the speed of work as
shown by the output curves.</p>

<p>Laboratory tests for the detection of accumulated
fatigue have not sufficiently justified the trouble
they involve, but observations as to complex reaction
time with letter or colour tests, determination of
acuity of auditory and visual sensations, and records
of the systolic blood-pressure may be found to serve
as an index to the incidence of fatigue when other
methods are not applicable.</p>

<p>There is no need to amplify these points. It only
remains to suggest that inquiry on such lines be
applied to groups of adolescent workers to discover
the extent to which industrial fatigue may be under-mining
the health and physique of growing girls.</p>

<p>It was stated above that the absence of accurate
data in the shape of records of the health of industrially
employed girls made it impossible to arrive
at any exact estimate of the effects of such work,
but the sickness returns of industrial Insurance
Societies must have been accumulating a vast mass
of evidence as to the particular ailments and diseases
to which employed girls are especially liable, so that
an examination of these records may be extremely
enlightening.</p>

<p>The secretary of the Insurance Section of the
Northern Counties Weavers' Amalgamation informed
us that at the present time the sickness returns of
this Association are not tabulated according to ages,
but that such tables could be obtained from the local
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>Unions and a complete estimate made if the need be
proved. One Weavers' Society, the Nelson and
District Weavers' Insurance Society, No. 1882,
which is outside the Amalgamation, does indeed
tabulate its records according to ages, but the total
number of women and girls in this society reaches
only 5982, so that far-reaching conclusions cannot
be drawn from its experience. Unfortunately not
all the members of the Trade Union are in the
Insurance section of their Society for the National
Insurance Benefit, but many belong to such Approved
Societies as the Prudential, the Blackburn
Unity, etc., so that evidence from these sources
cannot be regarded as entirely conclusive. Nevertheless,
were such data available for purposes of
comparison between one industry and another, considerable
evidence as to the particular effects of
different industries might be obtained.</p>

<p>During adolescence the plasticity of the human
organism makes it more easily affected by external
factors. Chief among the external influences which
may disturb normal development are the attitudes,
postures, and movements which industrial work
involves. If these are cramped and constrained the
healthy action of the heart and lungs and their
natural development may be retarded, while if
excessive muscular strain, such as that resulting
from heavy lifting or prolonged standing, is experienced,
active injury to vital organs may be
brought about, and similarly these factors and the
demands which excessive fatigue due to long hours,
etc., makes on the growing organism may result
in stunted growth and abnormal development.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>Information on these lines can only be obtained by
detailed anthropometric and medical examination,
and would have to be carried out on a large scale
if the datum is to be of any value. But the material
so collected would be the most reliable index of the
effect of industry on health and physique, and if
comparison be made between industrially employed
and unoccupied girls by examination of different
groups the final results would be invaluable. Such
an inquiry might be carried out by medical women
and anthropometric investigators in specific industries
throughout the country. The exact conditions
of the work, number of hours worked, etc.,
would have to be observed, and a record made of
the history as well as the present physical condition
of each girl examined. If groups of girls aged between
14 and 20 from different industries are thus
examined, comparison can be made by similar
examination amongst girls attending secondary
schools. In districts like north-east Lancashire,
where the pupils of the secondary schools are drawn
from the same class and from the same type of
home as the majority of the operatives, the exact
influence of industrial work will be more accurately
gauged than where the home environment differs
in the two groups.</p>

<p>An inquiry based on methods such as these would
be of vast national importance. What is needed is
exact scientific information available for the guidance
of those responsible for the organisation of
adolescent labour, and, more important still, as
a basis for new regulations controlling the extent
and conditions of this labour.</p>
